#### Dependencies
The report was written in Rmarkdown using Rstudio and has the following dependencies that can be installed using `install.packages("LIBRARY_NAME")`:

- dplyr
- tidyr
- ggplot2
- rmarkdown
- flexdashboard
- plotly
- pandoc (read troubleshooting notes)
- maps
- devtools::install_github('rstudio/leaflet')
- geojsonio (on ubuntu, installation fails many times and instructs to install dependencies)

#### Build and run
Once you have all the dependencies installed, you can clone the repository and use Knit in Rstudio to compile `index.Rmd`
in the project's root.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Pandoc
If you have trouble with Pandoc on Linux, check out [these instructions](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/master/PANDOC.md#newer-systems-debianubuntufedora).

Row 
-------------------------------------
### Active duty officers
The IAPro DB that OIPM has access to contains officer information that is not always in a useable form or up-to-date.
For the official count of active NOPD officers in 2017, we use data provided by NOPD. But for providing information about
officers involved in specific uses of force or complaints, we use information from the IAPro DB.

#### Info about officers related to each incident
- Download: TODO
- Source: OIPM direct DB access on May 18, 2018
- Issues: Does not have reliable dates of employment

#### Official count of all active duty officers in 2017
- Download: TODO
- Source: NOPD pull from ADP on May 11, 2018
- Issues: Can't cross reference with IAPro data

Row 
-------------------------------------
### Use of Force
2017 is the first year that OIPM has independent access to a copy of the database that contains force information.
We have used the data on data.nola.gov to compare with NOPD's version and cross reference with previously reported numbers.
We are unable to reproduce all of NOPD's previous figures, especially for 2015 where there is a large discrepancy.

#### Direct database access
- Download: TODO
- Source: OIPM direct DB access on May 18, 2016
- Issues: 2015 data mostly missing

#### data.nola.gov
- Download: TODO
- Issues: Does not contain a unique way to identify officers.

Row 
-------------------------------------
### FTN vs UOF
FTN stands for “force tracking number”. It is the designation given to track the entirety
of an interaction between NOPD and one or more individuals wherein force was used.

A single FTN corresponds to one or more UOF. If Officer A and Officer B both use their
hands against Individual C, the result would be one FTN, corresponding to two UOFs
(one for each officer). The same pattern would apply if there were multiple types of
force used or multiple individuals that force was used on.

This report will always clearly label whether FTN or UOF is being used for a particular
analysis but the onus is on the reader to remain vigilant of the distinction.

Row {data-height=300}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis
**Force by year**

- OIPM has same data for 2017. 2015 and 2016 still need to be confirmed.
- Force jumps between 2014 and 2015 because of new rules about what constitutes force. 
- UOF has been rising but FTN about steady. More <officers, victims, types of force> used per force incident.
- 2016 is the first year that the database that we access (IAPro) was used. Before then, we have to rely on
historic numbers from NOPD.
- Furthermore, 2017 is the first year the OIPM has had access to the underlying database. We worked with NOPD to resolve discrepancies with historic numbers.
- Force is flat from 2016 to 2017.
- *Still unclear where 2015 data came from*

**Force by month**

- UOF and FTN peak in Feb and August, corresponding to Mardi Gras and summertime.
- UOF has its third peak in Nov but FTN is low that month. This leads to a avg UOF/FTN of 4.5 which is around 2-3 the rest of the year.
- What is driving UOF most: citizens, types of force, num officers

Row 
-------------------------------------
### Use of force by year
```{r force.by.year, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
p.force.by.year
```

### FTN & UOF in 2017 by month
```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
p.force.by.month
```

Row {data-height=300}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis
**Level 1**

- L1 force decreasing.
- Exhibiting firearms has not changed
- Known that many officers unholster but don't point weapon which is not counted

**Level 2**

- L2 grew after shrinking the year before
- growth attributable to 66% growth in defense tech / take down.

**Level 3**

- l3 doubled from 3 to 6

**Level 4**

- l4 shrunk by 50%
- driven by reduction of canine bites to 0
- **where are taser hits??**


Row
-------------------------------------
### Level 1
```{r, fig.height = 3}
p.lvl.by.year[[1]]
```

### Level 2
```{r, fig.height = 3}

```

### Level 4
```{r, fig.height = 3}
p.lvl.by.year[[4]]
```

Row {data-height=300}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis
**By level**

- L1 and L2 force account for the vast amount of force used
- Exhibiting firearms accounts for as much force as all other types combined

**By district**

- 7th district and special operations have most force. 
- 7th has more than special ops. last year it was reversed
- 1st (mid city), 4th (algiers), 5th (bywater, treme, 9th ward) have only L1 and L2 force
- **add %lvl one force on another axis**

### Force by level and district
```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}

Row {data-height=300}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis
**Effectiveness**

- Like last year, all forms of taser use stand out as being least effective
- NOPD self determines effectiveness. Not clear what the guidelines are.
- all firearm discharges were deemed effective
- exhibiting firearms not effecive 8% = 59 instances where not effective
- hands not effective 10% of the time 
- How can 'other' force always be effective?

**NOPD's determination**

- 7 unauthorized instances of force. 
- last year there was only one. 7 is more in line with expectation of 6.
- 140, about 10% have outcomes that don't make sense
- **more details about these incidents**

Row
-------------------------------------
### Force by type and effectiveness 
```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}

### NOPD's determination of unauthorized force
```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
p.uof.by.disposition
```


Row {data-height=450}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis
**Level 1**

- Exhibiting firearms the overwhelming reason for using force
- combined with exhibiting tasers, accounts for 75% of low level force.
- aka 3 times more likely to pull out a weapon than use hands
- there are about as many l1 hands as l2 take down. 
- **why no taser hits??**

**Level 2**

- 77% take downs

**Level 3**

- is canine bite l3 or l4

Row
-------------------------------------
### Level 1
```{r, fig.height = 3}
uof.pies.each.type[[1]]
```

### Level 2
```{r, fig.height = 3}

```

### Level 3
```{r, fig.height = 3}

```

### Level 4
```{r, fig.height = 3}
uof.pies.each.type[[4]]
```

Row {data-height=300}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis

- other accounts for 19.4% of justifications for force. what is that?
- 30.9% firearm exhibits are other.
- this is still bigger than the overall other rate, but a decrease from last years staggering 50%

Row
-------------------------------------
### Reason for force
```{r, fig.height = 3}
p.uof.by.reason
```

### Reason for exhibiting firearms
```{r, fig.height = 3}

```

### What preceded force
```{r, fig.height = 3}
p.uof.by.service.type
```

Row {data-height=300}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis
**Force per officer**

- almost identical to last year.
- on average, an NOPD officer will be involved in a force incident once every other year.
- but only considering officers who used force at least once in 2017, the rate is closer to 3 incidents every 2 years.

**% using force**

- these results also very similar to 2016
- about 1/3 (~400+) of officers use force
- of those, 20 officers account for 20% of force. 
- not fair to say "bad apples" because many of those officers are in special ops (see below)
- trend is that UOF is higher than FTN meaning of officers using force more often, they are also more forceful when they do (more victims + types)
- there are many officers missing from IAPro. What's that about?

### Force by officer age and experience 

- As officers get older, they commit less force. 
- Officers 31 - 35 make up 14% of the police department but are responsible for over 350 incidents of force. 
- In the next age bucket, officers 26 - 40 make up 35% of all police (nearly double the previous bucket) but amount of force decreases.
- Experience levels are not enough to explain use of force. 
- Officers older than 31 tends to have over 5 years experience but continue to use non-negligible amounts of force.
- Not yet clear how assignment factors into this. Are older officers in admin roles where they are less likely to interact w/ publi?

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
p.uof.by.officer.age.exp
```

Row {data-height=150}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis

- given most force is exhibiting weapons, the injuries when physical force exerted is higher
- victims more likely to be injured as a result of force.
- both groups at non-trivial risk of injury

Row
-------------------------------------
### Officer injuries during UOF
```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}

Row {data-height=200}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis of UOF by victim gender and race

- Males have force used against them more often. 
- Black males are more often victims of force than black females.
- Inversely, white females have more force used against them than white males.
- Black people are most exposed to Firearms but white people get hands. 
- Asians and native amer have so little force, can't say much

### Analysis 
**Excessive force against black people by month**

- Like last year, force against black people eclipses population, arrests, and stops 11 of 12 months.
- january had a low 52% of force against black people
- stops and arrests of black people pretty stable. but force has much more variablility and does not seem correlated with either.

**By district**

- all districts except for 1st (mid city) use force against black people disproportionately to other metrics
- 2nd (broadmore) and 3rd (lakeview) are most disproportionate
- **waiting on arrest numbers by district**

Row
-------------------------------------
### Force used disproportionately against black people by month

Row {data-height=200}
-------------------------------------
### Analysis of UOF by officer gender and race

- males used more force
- white males use more force than all other groups even though they only account for 
- female officers use force proportional to their representation.
- male officers have the specific disproportionality  of white males using a lot of force.
- **add pie chart that includes officer race-sex in one large pie**

### Complaints vs allegation
When one or more individuals complain about an officer, a single tracking number is created. Each of these unique tracking numbers is considered a single complaint. Each complaint can contain one or more allegations of misconduct. 

Furthermore, its possible that each complaint/allegation is intiated by either a supervisor or anybody who is not their supervisor (including other officers). Complaints/allegations initiated by a superior are called "Rank Initiated" while all other complaints are "Citizen Initiated".

When a complaint/case contains more than one finding, select disposition in this order:
1. Sustained
2. Withdrawn / mediated
3. DI-2
4. Pending
5. Not sustained
6. Unfounded
7. Exonerated
8. NFIM
9. Illegitimate outcome
